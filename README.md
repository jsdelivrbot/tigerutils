Just a big bag of JS utilities. Every component (tries) to do one thing and (tries) to do
it well. Using them is simple. If you compose them you get something complex,
like a web application.

It's like the opposite of the all the other fancy things with their
rectangularivity and progressive virtual reality rendering or whatever.
